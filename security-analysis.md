Overview
The Security Analysis tab provides a comprehensive risk assessment of blockchain activity, offering key security metrics and threat indicators to help identify potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Key Components
1. Risk Assessment Metrics    
Metric	Value	Description    
Risk Score -> Aggregate security risk based on detected threats    
Network Congestion ->	Current network traffic level and gas price assessment    
Transaction Volume -> Number of transactions being monitored    
Security Alerts -> Count of active security warnings    
2. Risk Scoring System    
The risk score is calculated based on detected threats:    

0 points: No threats detected (Low risk)    
1-29 points: Some threats detected (Medium risk)    
30+ points: Multiple serious threats detected (High risk)    
Each type of threat contributes different point values to the overall risk score:    

High-frequency activity: 10 points per instance    
Sandwich attacks: 15 points per instance    
Rug pulls: 20 points per instance    
Honeypot contracts: 5 points per instance    
Token traps: 15 points per instance    
3. Network Status Indicators    
Network Congestion: Indicates blockchain network load    
Low: Normal operation    
Medium: Higher than normal activity    
High: Potential network stress or attack    
4. Risk Factor Details    
An expandable section provides detailed information about specific risk factors contributing to the current risk score, helping users understand the nature of detected threats.    

## Security Applications    
**Threat Prioritization:** Quickly identify the most serious security concerns    
**Risk Quantification:** Convert complex threat data into actionable metrics    
**Network Health:** Monitor blockchain congestion and activity levels    
**Trend Analysis:** Track security metrics over time to identify patterns    
The Security Analysis tab transforms raw blockchain data into meaningful security insights, enabling users to quickly assess the current threat landscape and prioritize their response.
